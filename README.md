FSScaner Version 1.1

(C) 2013 Jakob Hoyer

This is a simple application that queries FourSquare API for venues and
presents them as a list. Also some additional information is displayed
on each venue (distance, count of checkins, address if present, category icon).
The application also features Google Maps API - when a venue is tapped,
it is displayed on a map.


Featuring

* FourSquare API
